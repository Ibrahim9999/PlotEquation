# PlotEquation
Code for a plugin in Rhino that can plot equations

I've successfully created some code that can graph explicit 2D, 3D, and 4D equations in the CAD software Rhinoceros3D. I've extended the features of my program to include stereographic projections, mandelbrot, and 2D L-Systems. I'm currently working on implementing a 3D L-System. To do so, I need to make a 3D turtle with relative rotations such as yaw, pitch, and roll.

I am trying to create a 3D turtle with my Turtle class, but am experiencing issues with how to use Quaternions and Vectors to rotate correctly.
